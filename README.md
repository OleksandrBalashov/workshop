**Built with React.js, Redux, and Redux Toolkit**

Adverts Rent is powered by modern web technologies to ensure a smooth and
dynamic user experience. Here's a brief overview of the technologies used:

- **React.js:** Our frontend is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript
  library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of
  interactive components, making navigation and browsing listings effortless for
  users.

- **Redux:** Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps,
  commonly used with React for managing application state. It helps us maintain
  a centralized state for efficient data management across different components
  of the website.

- **Redux Toolkit:** Redux Toolkit is the official, opinionated toolset for
  efficient Redux development. It simplifies the process of writing Redux logic,
  providing utilities to streamline common tasks like store setup, reducer
  creation, and action handling.

With these powerful tools, Adverts Rent delivers a seamless browsing experience
while efficiently managing state and data flow, ensuring that users can find
their ideal rental property with ease.
